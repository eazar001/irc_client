This a low level IRC client library for making anything related to IRC
usage. For example, one can make a traditional bot, conversational
analyzer, simple logging system, statistics tracker, or even a full
blown IRC Chat application.

The main framework for this was directly taken out of a prolog IRC bot
called Yesbot, as an effort to provide more generic utilities for
these types of applications.

There is an examples folder containing examples that demonstrate how
this is meant to be used for the moment.

This still needs a lot of polish and is not ready for consumption yet.
