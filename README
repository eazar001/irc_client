This is a low level IRC client library for making anything related to
IRC usage. For example, one can make a traditional bot, conversational
analyzer, simple logging system, statistics tracker, or even a full
blown IRC Chat application.

There is an examples folder containing examples that demonstrate how
this is meant to be used for the moment. This may change over time.

This is definitely a work in progress, however it is also useable.
Enhancements and feature additions are planned for the future.
