This a low leveel IRC client library for making anything related to IRC usage.
For example, one can make a traditional bot, conversational analyzer, simple
logging system, statistics tracker, or even a full blown IRC Chat application.

This still needs a lot of polish and is not ready for consumption yet. The
basic framework for this library was taken straight out of a prolog bot called
Yesbot as an effort to provide more generic utilities for this sort of thing.
